# Task Tracker — Project Context (Module 1)

> **Archived snapshot — not current.** This is the Module 1 version of
> this document, preserved unchanged for reference. It does **not**
> reflect the real, current routes, models, storage layer, business
> rules, or test suite implemented in Module 2 (e.g. its "Current
> implementation status" section below still describes a health-check-only
> skeleton with no CRUD routes). Its stated business rule below — "a task
> with status `Done` cannot transition back to `ToDo` or `InProgress`" —
> also conflicts with what was actually implemented in Module 2: the
> `VALID_TRANSITIONS` set in `app/business_rules.py` explicitly allows
> `Done → InProgress` (only `Done → ToDo` and same-status transitions are
> rejected). This conflict is unresolved as of this writing. See

This file summarizes the decisions and requirements established for this
project so far, for anyone (human or AI) picking up the codebase without
prior context.

## What this project is

A Task Tracker REST API built with Python and FastAPI, as a learning
project (AI-Assisted Coding course, Module 1). Tasks have: `id`,
`title`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, `assignee`.

## Explicitly out of scope for Module 1

Authentication, user accounts, admin roles, multi-tenancy, per-user task
lists, real-time updates, mobile app, notifications, production database,
and deployment.

## Requirements

- **Create task**: title required (non-empty after trimming whitespace);
  missing/blank/whitespace-only title returns HTTP 422 with detail
  "Title is required and cannot be blank". `description` and `assignee`
  are optional.
- **View all tasks**: returns full list; empty list (not an error) if no
  tasks exist.
- **Filter tasks**: by `status` and/or `priority`, combinable with AND
  logic. Invalid filter values return HTTP 422.
- **View one task**: by id; HTTP 404 if the id doesn't exist.
- **Update task**: partial update (only sent fields change). Invalid
  `status`/`priority` values return HTTP 422, no change persisted.
  Updating a non-existent id returns HTTP 404.
- **Business rule**: a task with status `Done` cannot transition back to
  `ToDo` or `InProgress`. Attempting this returns HTTP 422 with a clear
  invalid-transition message; the task's status is unchanged.
- **Delete task**: removes the task, returns HTTP 204. Deleting a
  non-existent id returns HTTP 404.
- **Enums**:
  - `status`: `ToDo`, `InProgress`, `Done`
  - `priority`: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`
- `assignee` is a plain text label — not linked to authentication or
  user accounts.

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: Task Storage Approach

**Decision:** Use an in-memory data store (a Python dictionary) for
Module 1, instead of a real database like SQLite.

**Why:** This is a learning project focused on understanding how a REST
API works — creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. Adding a
real database at this stage would introduce extra complexity (setup,
queries, schema management) before the core API concepts are solid.

**Trade-off accepted:** All tasks are lost when the application
restarts. This is acceptable for Module 1, since the priority is
understanding the API itself, not data persistence.

**Alternative considered:** A SQLite database, which would keep data
between restarts and better resemble a real-world project. This was set
aside for now to keep the learning curve manageable, but may be
revisited in a later module.

### ADR-002: Testing Approach

**Decision:** Write tests directly against the in-memory store, with no
separate test database.

**Why:** This keeps testing simple and approachable while still building
the habit of writing tests early. It avoids adding database
setup/teardown complexity while foundational testing skills are still
being learned.

**Trade-off accepted:** These tests won't teach database-specific
testing practices (e.g., isolating a test database, managing fixtures).
That gap is acceptable for now and can be addressed in a future project
once database use is introduced.

**Alternative considered:** Using a real (test) database with fixtures
for more realistic testing. This was set aside to avoid layering two new
skills (testing and database management) at once.

## Current implementation status

- `app/main.py` currently contains **only** a `GET /health` endpoint
  (returns `{"status": "ok", "timestamp": "..."}`, HTTP 200). This was a
  deliberate scaffold-first step, reviewed and confirmed safe to build on.
- CRUD endpoints (create/list/get/update/delete tasks) matching the
  requirements above have **not yet been added back** to this file and
  are the next step.
- Project uses: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, python-dotenv (dotenv not
  yet wired up to actually load `.env` values).
- Storage layer (`TaskStore` in-memory dict) and Pydantic models
  (`TaskStatus`, `TaskPriority`, `Task`, `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`) were
  previously built and tested in an earlier version of this project, but
  are not currently present in the skeleton — they need to be
  re-added/rebuilt to match the requirements above (including the new
  Done → ToDo/InProgress transition rule, which was not in the original
  version).

## AI-assumption corrections made during planning

- An earlier draft assumed frontend "feedback on failure" implied a
  notification system; this was corrected to mean an inline UI error
  message, since notifications are out of scope.
- `assignee` was clarified as a plain text field, not linked to user
  accounts, to avoid it being mistaken for an authentication-adjacent
  feature.
